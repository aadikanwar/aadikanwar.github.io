Welcome 👋🏽! This website is essentially a portfolio collection of the projects that
I am currently working on; to ensure interactivity and readability,
they are written in a "blog-like" format! I hope to introduce as many
projects as I can on this website, and make sure that everyone can understand
them, regardless of experience in mathematics or computer science (although,
a bit of experience in either field may help :)).

I am a student at the University of British Colombia (UBC), currently pursuing
a bachelor's of science in computer science (although I am keen on pursuing math
either as a minor or adding it to my major itself!)

I am currently working on a directed reading project in which I explore primes
in a way that is visually appealing; namely via prime spirality. I do so by
first considering the Ulam spiral, and then the Archimedean spiral, and then
branching off into prime spirals and depictions of Gaussian and Eisenstein primes.
This project should be accessible to people of all mathematical background.
