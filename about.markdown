Welcome 👋🏽! This website is essentially a portfolio collection of the projects that
I am currently working on; to ensure interactivity and readability,
they are written in a "blog-like" format! I hope to introduce as many
projects as I can on this website, and make sure that everyone can understand
them, regardless of experience in mathematics or computer science (although,
a bit of experience in either field may help :)).
